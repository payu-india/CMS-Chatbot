## Points to Remember

1. While building the Subscription experience with different card schemes and issuers mentioned above, often a cross-verify final list with your PayU Account Manager. PayU recommends to contact your Account Manager because allocation some of the schemes is at “Discretion” of respective Issuer and Acquirers.
2. During the Consent transaction, if you are accepting card details on your website, use PayU’s BIN API to detect the card scheme and card issuer associated with the card entered. So that the if the card details entered by Customer is NOT supported for SI, it gets filtered out there itself rather than getting rejected at PayU’s end after customer is redirected to PayU.
3. Since PayU is working closely with more debit card issuers to offer SI regularly, the list of issuers supported for debit card SI can change over time. In this case, please maintain implementation of “Validating Card to support SI – Yes or No” flexible so that you can quickly offer new Issuers going ahead.
4. If you are redirecting the customer to PayU for accepting Card details during the Consent transaction, then only #1 is applicable because #2 and #3 are taken care at PayU’s end.
